## Setup

Save a plain text backup from Ente Auth, transfer it to your Mac and import it into the extension.

Currently the extension requires your backup to be plain text.
Future versions will accept also encrypted backups.

### Notes
Thanks to the authors of the [Authy Extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/blob/main/extensions/authy) and the [Aegis Extension](https://github.com/raycast/extensions/blob/main/extensions/aegis), from where most of the code for this extension was taken and modified to work with Ente Auth backups as the source.
